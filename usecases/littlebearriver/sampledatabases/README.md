Little Bear River Test Databases
=====================================
This folder contains multiple versions of the same dataset for multiple relational database management systems. The database contains approximately one month of continuous time series data for two monitoring sites, one water quality station in the Little Bear River and one weather station.  Also included are a number of water quality samples and associated results from the water quality station.

The source database for this use case was an ODM 1.1.1 database containing a small subset of the full dataset available for the Little Bear River.
