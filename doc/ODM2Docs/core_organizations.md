ODM2 Core: Organizations
========================

**Organizations** are included in ODM2 so that observations and other **Actions** can be associated with the **Organization** responsible for creating or performing them. **Organizations*** are groups of **People** with a common purpose or goal.  There are many different types of **Organizations**, including government agencies, academic research groups, private corporations, watershed monitoring groups, etc.  ODM2 does not contrain the types of **Organizations** that can be represented, but each **Organization** must have a type that is selected from a controlled vocabulary. The following are examples of Organization types:

* Federal agency
* State agency
* Academic Research Group
* Academic department
* University
* Non-profit
* Etc.

Organizations can have a code (e.g., "USGS"), a name (e.g., "United States Geological Survey"), a full text description, and a URL that links to the Organization's website (e.g., "http://www.usgs.gov"). Organizations can also have a parent Organization in the case of an Organization being a sub-unit of another Organization (e.g., the Utah Water Research Laboratory as a child Organization of Utah State University). 

Organizations are linked to **People** via Affiliations.  A Person can be affiliated with zero or more Organizations.  Affiliations have beginning and ending dates, and a Person's contact information (e.g., phone, email, address, website) is part of their affiliation with the Organization. An **Action** is performed by a Person who may or may not be affiliated with an Organization.
