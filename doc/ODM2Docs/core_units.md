ODM2 Core: Units
================

The ODM2 **Units** entity contains units of measure.  Units are described by a name, a type (from a controlled vocabulary), and a common abbreviation. Units are used to specify the units of measure for the data values within a Result. Units are separate from Variables and are specified at the Result level. In ODM2, multiple Results may exist for the same Variable, but specified with different Units. Units are a controlled vocabulary in ODM2.
