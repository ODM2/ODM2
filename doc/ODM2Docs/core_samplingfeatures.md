ODM2 Core: Sampling Features
============================

Every Action must be performed on or at a [**Sampling Feature**](http://ODM2.github.io/ODM2/schemas/ODM2_Current/tables/ODM2Core_SamplingFeatures.html). For example, a "Site visit" Action is made to a **Site** Sampling Feature. A "Laboratory analysis" Action is performed on a **Specimen** Sampling Feature. In the ODM2Core schema, the SamplingFeatures entity records the existence of all SamplingFeatures. Details of individual SamplingFeatures (e.g., Sites and Specimens) are given in the ODM2SamplingFeatures extension.  Sampling Features are described in more detail in the section about the [ODM2 Sampling Features](ext_samplingfeatures.md) extension.
